Time flies - it is ISMRM recap time once again! This year’s ISMRM Annual Meeting took place from the 3rd to the 8th of June in Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦.

It was a great week filled with amazing plenary talks and networking sessions where participants had the chance to learn about MR-related research that is being done all over the world 🌎.
Of course the Iberian presence in Toronto was remarkable. So many researchers presented their work brilliantly. You can see the Iberian work [here](https://ismrm-iberian.eu/2023/05/31/ISMRM23_highlight.html). There were two multilingual sessions where presentations were done in Portuguese or Spanish.

We also had not one, but TWO, researchers awarded with the junior fellowship (congratulations Joana and Gabriel). There was also a poster session dedicated to the different ISMRM chapters, and, of course, the Iberian Chapter poster was the shiniest (because everything is better with 🌞).
There were also moments for social gatherings, including attending a Blue Jays game and the Iberian social event. This event happened at the Steam Whistle Biergärten, in Toronto. Thanks to all Iberian amig@s for making these social events memorable!

It was great to see many of you in Toronto and we hope we get to see each other again next year in Singapore!

Até breve, Hasta pronto,
ISMRM Iberian Chapter
