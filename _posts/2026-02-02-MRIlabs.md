We're thrilled to invite you to the 4th MRIberian Labs event! 🎉
This is an exciting 2-hour online opportunity to connect with colleagues and discover the fantastic work being done within the Iberian MRI community.

It is open to all Iberian chapter members and to any scientists interested in joining!

We have an impressive lineup of 10 speakers - a big thank you to all who signed up! 

The online event (link and details on the attached flyer) will be held on February 5th at 2 pm/3 pm (LIS/SPAIN time).

Looking forward to a great session! 
Yours truly,
