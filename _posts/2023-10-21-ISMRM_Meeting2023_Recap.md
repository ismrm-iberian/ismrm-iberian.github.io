üìÖ **Day 1**  

We started the first day of the **ISMRM Iberian Chapter Annual Meeting 2023 in Valladolid** with an opening ceremony given by **Prof. Rita Nunes**, the Chair of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter, **Prof. Carlos Alberola-L√≥pez**, Chair of the Scientific Committee, and **Dr. Antonio Largo**, the President of the University of Valladolid.

The first inspiring plenary talk of the meeting was given by **Dr. Jorge Cardoso** (King‚Äôs College in London), entitled "Safe & Robust AI in a highly heterogenous data environment". A clinical oral session followed before the lunch break.

After the lunch break, we had a standard poster session, including a poster teaser session. After a short coffee break, a round table took place, moderated by **Prof. Carlos Alberola-L√≥pez** and with the presence of **Dr. Borja Ib√°√±ez** (CNIC), **Dr. David Filgueiras** (CNIC) and **Dr. Javier S√°nchez-Gonz√°lez** (Philips Healthcare), on the topic of "CNIC: a model of public-private collaboration in research".

üìÖ **Day 2**  
On the second day, we started early with a fantastic plenary talk given by **Dr. Mar√≠a Luisa Garc√≠a Mart√≠n**, from the Andalusian Center for Nanomedicine and Biotechnology (Bionand) entitled "Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy in Biomedical Research". 

Next, we had a poster teaser and a standard poster session, followed by a "Heart & Hardware" oral session. The morning was completed with an extraordinary plenary talk by **Dr. Joseba Alonso** entitled "MRI for everybody, everywhere", from the Polytechnic University of Valencia, on the topic of low field MRI. 

**Bruker** kindly sponsored a lunch session called **"Lunch with Bruker"**, where they highlighted their newest developments in the pre-clinical field.

After the lunch break, an oral "Preclinical" session was carried out, followed by a new type of session organized by **Prof. Santiago Aja-Fern√°ndez**: **fu-MRI (funny Magnetic Resonance Ideas)**, where several of our researchers shared funny thoughts about their research, or ideas that were left aside because they were too bold, too bizarre or, maybe, too wrong.

Following the fu-MRI session, a short pitch was given by **MR Solutions**, which presented their recent advances in the field.

Finally, the meeting was finished with awards for the best talks and posters, and some closing words given by **Prof. Rita Nunes** and **Prof. Carlos Alberola-L√≥pez**.
