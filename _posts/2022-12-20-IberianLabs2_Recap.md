The second ISMRM Iberian Chapter MRI labs event took place online on the 13th of December 2022. On this second edition of the MRIberian Labs event, 
we focused on clinical research and we had representatives from 8 Magnetic Resonance laboratories in Iberia. üß≤üê≠  

The MRIberian Labs events have the objective of introducing the different MRI laboratories across Iberia, and sharing their latest developments in research, equipment 
and facilities.
