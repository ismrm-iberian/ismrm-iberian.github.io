The first **ISMRM Iberian Chapter MRI labs event** took place online on the 6th of April 2022. Here, representatives from 16 Magnetic Resonance laboratories üß≤ based in Iberia, from **Barcelona, San Sebasti√°n, Pamplona, Valencia, Alicante, Madrid, Lisbon, Faro and Coimbra**, shared an overview of their different research lines, experience, available equipment and facilities. The objective of the Iberian Labs event is to foment a collaborative environment among the different MRI labs across Iberia.  

The talks exhibited the great science made by the Iberian community, covering a wide range of Magnetic Resonance techniques such as functional MRI, parametric and quantitative MRI, Molecular Imaging, Spectroscopy, Multi-Modal MRI (with EEG and PET) as well as the hardware used. 

Moreover, the lab representatives showed the clinical and preclinical applications of these techniques, for instance, Neuroimaging applied to immunology, olfactory evaluations, behaviour and language. Also, applied to the study of brain diseases such as glioma or Alzheimer‚Äôs, migraine, epilepsy, Parkinson or deafness. Nevertheless, the brain was not the only ‚Äústar-organ‚Äù of this event, as we also had excellent talks about renal and cardiac imaging.

Recordings of the talks can be followed on our [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYMksT3UbDpnF8Q-z9mKc3rQtOoikO4tk)

The winner of the **First ISMRM Iberian Chapter Newbie Prize** (free ISMRM membership and free registration for the ISMRM 2022 conference) was Raquel Araujo üèÜ! The competition consisted of a 3 minutes pitch about why they should attend the ISMRM conference. The remaining participants, Marco Barbero, Alex Vergara, Cl√°udia Fonseca and Catarina Passarinho got a very special gift: an ISMRM Iberian Chapter mug and a free registration for the ISMRM Iberian Chapter meeting in Lisbon.  

At the end of the session, attendees got together in Gather Town to discuss the different presentations.  

We hope this was the first of many future MRI labs events! To continue sharing the cutting-edge science of the Iberian community, we encourage more Iberians to share with us their groups, either from labs located in Iberia or from around the world.  

Thanks to all the MRI labs and the Newbies contestants for participating! ‚ú®
