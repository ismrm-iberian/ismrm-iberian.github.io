We're thrilled to invite you to the 4th MRIberian Labs event! 🎉
This is an exciting 2-hour online opportunity to showcase your research, connect with colleagues, and discover the fantastic work being done within the Iberian MRI community.
We are looking for PIs or lab representatives to give a presentation on their group's research.

**What**: A 2-hour online event for Iberian labs to present their research.

**Who**: Open to all Iberian chapter members, and a warm welcome to any scientists interested in joining!

**When**: Tentatively scheduled for Thursday, 5th February, 2pm PT / 3pm ES

**Format**: One presentation per group (approx. 10 min) to ensure we hear from as many labs as possible.

Interested in presenting your lab? Please fill out this short [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed5vg4VK7BnpuOOGIQx4hFY5g59zVlwWwFBomaaV1UKTJfuA/viewform), and we'll be in touch. We especially encourage applications from labs who did not participate in the last meeting.

Yours truly,
Iberian Chapter Committee
