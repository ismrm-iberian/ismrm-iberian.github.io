Last 9th of January, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas Alberto Sols, CSIC-UAM (IIBm) in Madrid held an in memoriam tribute to Professor Sebastián Cerdán. A very emotional act where not only his scientific merits where celebrated, but also his positive influence in his friends, colleagues and students.
Carles Arús Caraltó from Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Mario Vallejo and Pilar López Larrubia (IIBm) and Tiago Brandão Rodrigues, member of the Portuguese Parliament, shared their experiences with Sebastián as a friend, colleague and mentor.
