## Iberians Around the World

### MR Structural Quantitative Imaging

- Radboud University. Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
- The **MR Structural Quantitative Imaging lab** aims are to develop new strategies to acquire high resolution and informative quantitative MRI; and to understand the contrast mechanisms that give rise to the observed relaxation and electromagnetic contrasts in brain tissues.
- Main research topics: *Relaxometry acquisition & reconstruction, QSM, MWI*

### Quantitative Imaging Methods Lab

- University of Wisconsin-Madison. Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
- The **Quantitative Imaging Methods Lab** develops new techniques, particularly for quantitative body MRI, and works with physicists, engineers, basic scientists, and clinicians, to validate and apply these techniques.
- Main research topics: *quantitative, diffusion, susceptibility, iron, fat*

### NeuroPoly Lab

- Polytechnique Montreal. Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
- **NeuroPoly** is a research laboratory that is co-directed by 4 principal investigators that specialize in neuroimaging. We develop advanced MRI image acquisition and analysis methods for brain and spinal cord imaging at 3 T and 7 T. 
- Main research topics: *B0 mapping, shimming, UHF, quantitative MRI, open-science*
